You are my happiness and my happiness doesn’t exist without you.', 'So far, every moment we have spent together has been awesome. But I promise you, that the best is yet to come.', 'Since the time I have met you, I cry a little less, laugh a little harder and smile all the more, just because I have you, my life is a better place.', 'You are my paradise and I would happily get stranded on you for a lifetime', 'Just when I think that it is impossible to love you any more than I already do, you prove me wrong.', 'I wake to think of you and I sleep to see you in my dreams.
